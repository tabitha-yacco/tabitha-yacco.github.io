<br>These results show my personality in depth, I find it hard to be extraverted and make new friends, I guess its due to the low view of myself. However I can work in a team if needed
it does show that its not a preferred way of working but is one that I can deal with. If I was forming a team I would need to find people who value harmony and dislike conflict as well as
find importance in their work and position. </p>

<br>These results show my learning style, I do prefer to have things written down for me as well as explained. In a team it would be preffered if I was shown how to do something and as I can
take notes on how I will be doing things. When forming a team, I would like to have everything written out and explained for everyone in a indepth profile so that it may help everyone.
