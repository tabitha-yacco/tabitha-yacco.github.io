<p>I'm of an Assyrian background but born in Australia, so I guess i'm Australian. I have had a long battle with depression and it has caused
me to not be able to continue in long term studies since leaving high school in 2009. I did go to tafe for a short period of time and I studied
Laboratory Tech which was awesome. I can speak English and Assyrian. I'm into gaming mostly, or playing with my pets, currently have a cat named Lunar
and my German Shepherd dog named Auditore (Audi for short). I named him after a game character, <small>don't worry.. I know its sad now.</small></p>
