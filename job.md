<p>To be honest, I'm not entirely sure if I want to work in big data or in security, but what mostly makes this appealing to me is the challenging aspect of it. So in big data I believe it is
helping the company achieve greater things, I want to help in doing that for a workplace I enjoy, it also includes coding and learning languages in which I believe i'm good at. </p>

<p>For this specific job, i'd be needing to get more into Computer Science as well as Mathematics. I'd have to learn more cloud-based technologies in Azure, as well as programming experience
in Python. I'd also need previous experience in big data and similar jobs. </p>

<p>I currently do not have sufficient experience for this job, I have worked in building PC's and other general jobs. Nothing related to coding and computer science.</p>

<p>My current plan I have is to continue in my studies and get into a Bachelor of Information Technology & Data Analytics which i'm sure will provide me with the structure I need and
skills I need for jobs like the one I listed above. I also plan to learn and play around with Python as well as other languages in my own time to see how well I can catch on.</p>
