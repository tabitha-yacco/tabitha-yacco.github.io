<p>So there is a couple of projects i'd like to look into, i'd like to create an iOS app, i'd like to create a FiveM server using my own scripts and i'd like to build an Airplay Mirroring device for my TV.
I'm going to focus on the Mirroring device. </p>
<p>A mirroring device to allow my phone to Airplay to a TV that doesn't have an Apple TV connected to it.</p>

<p>So recently Netflix has removed the capability to Airplay onto Apple TV and now ask you to just use the Apple TV Netflix app instead. The app itself has some issues which is why I preferred to use the Airplay function. However
in my room I do not have an Apple TV box and would like to have a device that allows me to Airplay onto my TV so i'm not watching Netflix on my phone. Using Raspberry Pi for this would be acceptable and is easy to do. </p>
<p> A basic reciever that can Airplay onto my Smart TV. It'll start up with my TV and will connect automatically to the WiFi connection and when there is a Airplay enabled device and you open that menu it'll pop up in there enabling 
the user to choose the reciever and mirror the device onto the TV</p>
<p>For this to work, you'd need a Raspberry Pi, a WiFi dongle, a PC, USB keyboard/Mouse, MicroSD card (4GB+), TV, HDMI cable, MicroUSB charger. The software you'd be looking at using is Raspbian which is a sort of OS for the Raspberry Pi & RPiPlay
which is an open-source Airplay mirroring server for Raspberry Pi. </p>
<p>All of the above are easily found and bought online and some in stores. The only difficulty would be putting it together. Setting up your Pi isn't too hard also as there are lots of guides online now, as well as setting up the software needed
in regards to RPiPlay</p>
<p>If this is successful it would allow users to Airplay and Mirror their devices onto anything that has a HDMI connection and that is on the same internet network as the Apple device you'd be using. Therefore replacing the need for an AppleTV which
would probably work out more expensive than this alternative.</p>
