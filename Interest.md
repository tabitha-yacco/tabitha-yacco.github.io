<p>I've always been interested in Information Technology, well mostly the hardware side of things, it started with building computers and putting the parts together.
  I also enjoyed looking into Virtual Machines and used to have a MAC on my Windows computer. I then started to get interested in hacking games, such as Hacknet, not like
  I was really hacking anything at the time but just the way technology is used in so many ways is interesting, it has so many capabilities and can be forged into anything
  the user wants.</p>
<p>I didn't have a particular reason on why I chose RMIT, I wanted to actually do Information Technology & Data Analytics course intially but as I said previously, I have had depression
for a couple of years now, so I haven't really been productive. I'm starting to get myself together and thought the best thing to do is start off slowly with two subjects on OUA.
I kind of regret not going on campus, the structure would've helped a lot but now I am here and want to make this work.</p>

<p>I'm already learning a lot, I used to look at GitHub and think "Wow! this looks complicated" but I seem to have it kind of worked out for now. I expect to learn a lot when it comes to
computing languages and skills that I can use later in further subjects. I know that after these two subjects I will be looking to go on campus (Hopefully) if not I will continue another two
until I get into the data analytics course.</p>
